# User Authentication API

## Start with `/api/v1/user`

This is a simple Node.js API for user authentication using Prisma for database operations and Hono for routing. The API provides endpoints for user signup and signin, generating JWTs for authenticated access.

## Routes

### GET `/simp`

- Description: A simple route that returns the text "ANIME!" when accessed.
- Method: GET

### POST `/signup`

- Description: Route for user signup.
- Method: POST
- Body Schema:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "name": "string"
  }

### POST `/signin`

- Description: Route for user signin.
- Method: POST
- Body Schema:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
  }


Certainly! Here's the README.md template for your GitHub repository explaining the endpoints defined in your code:

# Blog API

This Node.js API provides endpoints for creating, updating, and fetching blog posts. User authentication is required for certain endpoints.

## Endpoints

### Middleware

Middleware ensures that users must be logged in before reading or writing blogs. It verifies the JWT token provided in the `Authorization` header.

- If the token is valid, it sets the `userId` in the request context (`ctx`) for further processing.
- If the token is invalid or missing, it returns a 403 Forbidden status with a JSON response indicating the issue.

### POST `/`

- Description: Create a new blog post.
- Method: POST
- Body Schema:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "string",
    "content": "string"
  }
  ```
- Process:
  1. Parses the JSON body to ensure it matches the `createBlogInput` schema.
  2. If input is incorrect, returns a status code 411 with a JSON response indicating "Inputs not correct".
  3. Retrieves the `userId` from the request context.
  4. Creates a new blog post in the database with the provided `title`, `content`, and `authorId`.
  5. Returns a JSON response with the ID of the newly created blog post.

### PUT `/`

- Description: Update an existing blog post.
- Method: PUT
- Body Schema:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "number",
    "title": "string",
    "content": "string"
  }
  ```
- Process:
  1. Parses the JSON body to ensure it matches the `updateBlogInput` schema.
  2. If input is incorrect, returns a status code 411 with a JSON response indicating "Inputs not correct".
  3. Updates the blog post with the provided `id` in the database with the new `title` and `content`.
  4. Returns a JSON response with the ID of the updated blog post.

### GET `/bulk`

- Description: Fetch all blog posts.
- Method: GET
- Process:
  1. Retrieves all blog posts from the database.
  2. Returns a JSON response with an array of blog posts including their `id`, `title`, `content`, and `author` details.

### GET `/:id`

- Description: Fetch a single blog post by ID.
- Method: GET
- Parameters:
  - `id`: The ID of the blog post to retrieve.
- Process:
  1. Retrieves the blog post with the provided `id` from the database.
  2. Returns a JSON response with the blog post details including its `id`, `title`, `content`, and `author` details.

## Getting Started

To get started with this API, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- PostgreSQL database installed and running

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd blog-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Define the following variables:

     ```
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ```

5. Apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

6. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

You can now use the defined endpoints to interact with the API. Make sure to include the required authentication token in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.
